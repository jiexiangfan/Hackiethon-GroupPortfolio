The dissolution of self was achieved by altering the player‚Äôs virtual body to look as if it had itself become water, and using post-processing effects such as increasing the intensity of chromatic aberration and the vignette.The purpose of this scene was to slowly ease the player into a relaxed state. The best approach to this is to try and regulate the player‚Äôs breathing. To achieve this, semi-transparent mushrooms that glow brightly were placed on the rocky side walls of the environment in the peripheral of the player‚Äôs view. Hallucinogens are mostly commonly associated with magic mushrooms, a type of fungi that contains the psychoactive compound, psilocybin",

The backdrop in front of the player is a cosmic sized feminine gender-neutral human looking downwards with her/his hands cupped, as if holding water. Floating beside at head level are two distant planets with an animated psychedelic material. Surrounding the entire scene is a semi-transparent dome with an animated kaleidoscope-like shader applied. The humans and planets in the backdrop aim to give a sense of vastness. The player floats at the centre of an infinite open lane surrounded by various interesting compositions at the sides, spawning in an infinite loop towards the horizon. These compositions consist of various small islands with waterfalls. Some islands have iridescently colored humans sitting in a meditative pose. Most of these small islands have trees with continuously changing hues. A post-processing effect is added to slowly continuously change the hue of the entire scene, making the world feel alive with surreal colour. In this scene the player‚Äôs virtual body is removed. The reason for this is that we wanted to make this scene an OBE.",
